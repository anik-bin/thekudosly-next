## About the Project

YouTube's vast library contains countless educational and informative videos that deserve more attention. However, many of these videos remain hidden due to recommendation algorithms that prioritize engagement metrics over actual value.

thekudosly solves this problem by empowering users to:
- **Recommend valuable videos** they've discovered
- **Give kudos** to videos they find valuable
- **Discover content** recommended by a community of like-minded individuals

## Key Features

### Kudos System
Every day, users receive 3 kudos they can award to videos they appreciate. This token of recognition helps highlight quality content and rewards users who contribute valuable recommendations.

### Video Recommendations
Users can easily share YouTube videos they find valuable with the community. Each recommendation requires one kudos, ensuring users are thoughtful about what they share.

### User Profiles
Build your reputation as a curator of quality content. Your profile showcases the videos you've recommended and appreciated, allowing others to discover content through curators they trust.

## Coming Soon
